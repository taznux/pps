======= Making a Django application =======

idx{Django!installation}

We recommend to
download and istall the latest official version of Django from
URL: "http://www.djangoproject.com/download/". Pack out the tarfile, go
to the directory, and run `setup.py`:

!bc sys
Terminal> tar xvzf Django-1.5-tar.gz
Terminal> cd Django-1.5
Terminal> sudo python setup.py install
!ec
The version in this example, 1.5, may be different at the time you
follow these instructions.


===== Setting up a Django project =====

idx{Django!making a project}

Django applies two concepts: *project* and *application* (or *app*).
The app is the program we want to run through a web interface. The
project is a Python package containing common settings and
configurations for a collection of apps. This means that before we can
make a Django app, we must to establish a Django project.

A Django project for managing a set of Django apps is
created by the command

!bc sys
Terminal> django-admin.py startproject django_project
!ec
The result in this example
is a directory `django_project` whose content can be explored
by some `ls` and `cd` commands:

!bc sys
Terminal> ls django_project
manage.py django_project
Terminal> cd django_project/django_project
Terminal> ls
__init__.py settings.py urls.py wsgi.py
!ec
The meaning of the generated files is briefly listed below.

   * The outer `django_project/` directory is just a container for your project. Its name does not matter to Django.

   * `manage.py` is a command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You will typically run `manage.py` to launch a Django application.

   * The inner `django_project/` directory is a Python package for the Django project. Its name is used in import statements in Python code (e.g., `import django_project.settings`).

   * `django_project/__init__.py` is an empty file that just tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.

   * `django_project/settings.py` contains the settings and configurations for this Django project.

   * `django_project/urls.py` maps URLs to specific functions and thereby defines that actions that various URLs imply.

   * `django_project/wsgi.py` is not needed in our examples.

Django comes with a web server for developing and debugging applications.
The server is started by running

!bc sys
Terminal> python manage.py runserver
Validating models...

0 errors found
March 34, 201x - 01:09:24
Django version 1.5, using settings 'django_project.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
!ec
The output from starting the server tells that the server runs on the
URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
Load this URL into your browser to see a welcome message from Django,
meaning that the server is working.

Despite the fact that our introductory
web applications do not need a database, you
have to register a database with any Django project. To this end,
open the `django_project/settings.py` file in a text editor,
locate the `DATABASES` dictionary and type in the following
code:

!bc pycod
import os

def relative2absolute_path(relative_path):
    """Return the absolute path correspodning to relative_path."""
    dir_of_this_file = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    return dir_of_this_file + '/' + relative_path

DATABASES = {
   'default' : {
      'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
      'NAME': relative2absolute_path('../database.db')
   }
}
!ec
The `settings.py` file needs absolute paths to files, while it is
more convenient for us to specify relative paths. Therefore,
we made a function that figures out the absolute path to the `settings.py`
file and then combines this absolute path with the relative path.
The location and name of the database file can be chosen as desired.
Note that one should *not* use `os.path.join` to create paths as Django
always applies the forward slash between directories, also on Windows.


===== Setting up a Django application =====

idx{Django!making an application}

The next step is to create a Django app for our scientific hello
world program. We can place the app in any directory, but here we
utilize the following organization.
As neighbor to `django_project` we have
a directory `apps` containing our various scientific applications.
Under `apps` we create a directory `django_apps` with
our different versions of Django applications.
The directory `py_apps` contains the
original `hw.py` program in the subdirectory `orig`,
while split of this
program according to the MVC pattern appears in the `mvc` directory.

The directory `django_apps/hw1` is our first attempt to write
a Django-based web interface for the `hw.py` program.
The directory structure is laid out by
!bc sys
Terminal> cd ..
Terminal> mkdir apps
Terminal> cd apps
Terminal> mkdir py_apps
Terminal> cd py
Terminal> mkdir orig mvc
Terminal> cd ../..
Terminal> mkdir django_apps
Terminal> cd django_apps
!ec
The file `hw.py` is moved to `orig` while `mvc` contains
the MVC refactored version with the files `model.py`, `view.py`, `compute.py`,
and `controller.py`.

The `hw1` directory, containing our first Django application, must be
made with
!bc sys
Terminal> python ../../django_project/manage.py startapp hw1
!ec
The command creates a directory `hw1` with four empty files:

!bc sys
Terminal> cd hw1
Terminal> ls
__init__.py models.py tests.py views.py
!ec
The `__init__.py` file will remain empty to just indicate that the
Django application is a Python package. The other files need to be
filled with the right content, which happens in the next section.

At this point,
we need to register some information about our application in the
`django_project/settings.py` and `django_project/urls.py` files.

__Step 1: Add the app.__ Locate the `INSTALLED_APPS`
tuple in `settings.py` and add your Django application as a Python package:

!bc pycod
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    ...
    'hw1',
)
!ec
Unfortunately, Django will not be able to find the package `hw1`
unless we register the parent directory in `sys.path`:

!bc pycod
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, relative2absolute_path('../../apps/django_apps'))
!ec
Note here that the relative path is given with respect to the
location of the `settings.py` script.

__Step 2: Add a template directory.__
Make a subdirectory `templates` under `hw1`,

!bc sys
Terminal> mkdir templates
!ec
and add the absolute path of this directory to the `TEMPLATE_DIRS` tuple:

!bc pycod
TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    relative2absolute_path('../../apps/django_apps/hw1/templates'),
)
!ec
The `templates` directory will hold templates for the HTML code applied
in the web interfaces. The trailing comma is important as this is
a tuple with only one element.

__Step 3: Define the URL.__ We need to connect the Django app with
an URL. Our app will be associated with a Python function `index`
in the `views` module within the `hw1` package.
Say we want the corresponding URL to
be named `hw1` relative to the server URL.
This information is registered in the `django_project/urls.py` file
by the syntax

!bc pycod
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^hw1/', 'django_apps.hw1.views.index'),
!ec
The first argument to the `url` function is a regular expression for
the URL and the second argument is the name of the function to call,
using Python's syntax for a function `index` in a module `views` in
a package `hw1`.
The function name `index` resembles the `index.html` main page associated
with an URL, but any other name than `index` can be used.

!split
===== Programming the Django application =====

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'django_apps/hw1'
%>

The Django application is about filling the files `views.py` and `models.py`
with content. The mathematical computations are performed in `compute.py`
so we copy this file from the `mvc` directory to the `hw1` directory
for convenience (we could alternatively add `../mvc` to `sys.path` such that
`import compute` would work from the `hw1` directory).

=== The user interaction ===

The web application offers a text field where the user can
write the value of `r`, see Figure ref{wf:hw1:django:fig:input}.
After clicking on the *equals* button,
the mathematics is performed and a new page as
seen in Figure ref{wf:hw1:django:fig:result} appears.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/hw1_django_input, width=600] The input page. label{wf:hw1:django:fig:input}

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/hw1_django_output, width=600] The result page. label{wf:hw1:django:fig:result}

idx{Django!input forms}
idx{Django!`models.py`}

=== The model ===

The `models.py` file contains the model, which consists
of the data we need in the application, stored in Django's data types.
Our data consists of one number, called `r`, and `models.py` then
look like

@@@CODE ${app_path}/models.py
The `Input` class lists variables representing data as static class
attributes. The `django.db.models` module contains various classes
for different types of data, here we use `FloatField` to represent
a floating-point number.
The `InputForm` class has a the shown generic form across applications
if we by convention apply the name `Input` for the class holding the data.

idx{Django!`index` function}
idx{Django!`views.py`}

=== The view ===

The `views.py` file contains a function `index` which defines
the actions we want to perform when invoking
the URL ( here `http://127.0.0.1:8000/hw1/`).
In addition, `views.py` has the `present_output` function from
the `view.py` file in the `mvc` directory.

@@@CODE ${app_path}/views.py

The `index` function deserves some explanation. It must take one
argument, usually called `request`. There are two modes in the function. Either
the user has provided input on the web page, which means that
`request.method` equals `'POST'`, or we show a new web page
with which the user is supposed to interact.

idx{Django!HTML templates}

=== Making the input page ===

The input consists of a web form with
one field where we can fill in our `r` variable. This page
is realized by the two central statements

!bc pycod
# Make info needed in the web form
form = InputForm()
# Make HTML code
render_to_response('hw1.html',
    {'form': form}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
!ec
The `hw1.html` file resides in the `templates` subdirectory and contains
a template for the HTML code:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/hw1.html
This is a *template file* because it contains instructions like
`{% csrf_token %}` and variables like `{{ form.r }}`. Django will
replace the former by some appropriate HTML statements, while the
latter simply extracts the numerical value of the variable `r` in
our form (specified in the `Input` class in `models.py`).
Typically, this `hw1.html` file
results in the HTML code

!bc htmlpro
<form method="post" action="">
<div style='display:none'>
<input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken'
value='oPWMuuy1gLlXm9GvUZINv49eVUYnux5Q' /></div>
    Hello, World! The sine of <input type="text" name="r" id="id_r" />
    <input type="submit" value="equals" />
</form>
!ec

=== Making the results page ===

When then user has filled in a value in the text field on the input
page, the `index` function is called again and `request.method` equals
`'POST'`. A new form object is made, this time with user info (`request.POST`).
We can check that the form is valid and if so, proceed with
computations followed by presenting the results in a
new web page (see Figure ref{wf:hw1:django:fig:result}):

!bc pycod
def index(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = InputForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form = form.save(commit=False)
            return present_output(form)

def present_output(form):
    r = form.r
    s = compute(r)
    return HttpResponse('Hello, World! sin(%s)=%s' % (r, s))
!ec
The numerical value of `r` as given by the user is available as `form.r`.
Instead of using a template for the output page, which is natural to
do in more advanced cases, we here illustrate the possibility to
send raw HTML to the output page by returning an `HttpResponse`
object initialized by a string containing the desired HTML code.

Launch this application by filling in the address `http://127.0.0.1:8000/hw1/`
in your web browser. Make sure the Django development server is running,
and if not, restart it by

!bc sys
Terminal> python ../../../django_project/manage.py runserver
!ec
Fill
in some number on the input page and view the output.
To show how easy it is to change the application, invoke the `views.py`
file in an editor and add some color to the output HTML code from
the `present_output` function:

!bc pycod
    return HttpResponse("""
<font color='blue'>Hello</font>, World!
sin(%s)=%s
"""% (r, s))
!ec
Go back to the input page, provide a new number, and observe how
the "Hello" word now has a blue color.


===== Equipping the input page with output results =====

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'django_apps/hw2'
%>

Instead of making a separate output page with the result, we can
simply add the sine value to the input page. This makes the user
feel that she interacts with the same page, as when operating a calculator.
The output page should then look as shown in Figure ref{wf:hw2:django:fig:result}.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/hw2_django_output, width=600] The modified result page. label{wf:hw2:django:fig:result}

We need to make a new Django application, now called
"`hw2`" : "${github_path}/${app_path}".
Instead of running the standard
`manage.py startapp hw2` command,
we can simply copy the `hw1`
directory to `hw2`. We need, of course, to add information about this
new application in `settings.py` and `urls.py`.
In the former file we must have

!bc pycod
TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    relative2absolute_path('../../apps/django_apps/hw1/templates'),
    relative2absolute_path('../../apps/django_apps/hw2/templates'),
)

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
    # 'django.contrib.admin',
    # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation:
    # 'django.contrib.admindocs',
    'hw1',
    'hw2',
)
!ec
In `urls.py` we add the URL `hw2` which is to call our `index` function
in the `views.py` file of the `hw2` app:

!bc pycod
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^hw1/', 'django_apps.hw1.views.index'),
    url(r'^hw2/', 'django_apps.hw2.views.index'),
!ec

The `views.py` file changes a bit since we shall generate almost the same
web page on input and output. This makes the `present_output` function
unnatural, and everything is done within the `index` function:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/views.py  fromto: def index@

Note that the output variable `s` is computed within the `index`
function and defaults to `None`. The template file `hw2.html`
looks like

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/hw2.html
The difference from `hw1.html` is that we right after the *equals*
button write out the value of `s`. However, we make a test that
the value is only written if it is computed, here recognized by
being a non-empty string. The `s` in the template file
is substituted by the value of the object
corresponding to the key `'s'` in the
dictionary we pass to the `render_to_response`. As seen,
we pass a string where `s` is formatted with five digits if `s`
is a float, i.e., if `s` is computed. Otherwise, `s` has the
default value `None` and we send an empty string to the template.
The template language allows tests using Python syntax, but the
if-block must be explicitly ended by `{% endif %}`.
